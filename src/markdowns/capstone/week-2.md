### Overview

This week has been a pivotal moment for my project. After finalizing my prototype proposal, I discovered a deeper purpose that has given it even more significance. It has motivated me to make significant progress on my proof of concept, overcoming obstacles and pushing forward. Additionally, I have taken the exciting step of diving into user research, which will play a crucial role in shaping the direction of my project. These developments have infused me with a renewed sense of enthusiasm and determination to bring my vision to life.

### Digging Deeper: Uncovering a Renewed Purpose

After our Tuesday class discussion I reevaluated my project's purpose. Instead of targeting a specific academic audience, I realized my focus should be on addressing the pervasive issue of spiritual abuse within Christian communitiesâ€”a personal burden. To tackle this, my project has two primary objectives: combating the misuse and abuse of scripture and making biblical knowledge accessible to all.

To achieve these objectives, I will create a user-friendly research tool that provides unbiased biblical backgrounds, comprehensive information, and rich historical and cultural context. By offering raw facts and a balanced perspective, users can develop their own understanding, challenge misconceptions, and navigate scripture responsibly. This tool will be accessible to pastors, students, laypersons, and anyone interested in biblical study.

Ultimately, my project seeks to empower individuals within faith communities, equipping them with the necessary tools to uncover the truth independently, address misconceptions, and diminish the risk of scripture being twisted to manipulate others. While it may not directly combat spiritual abuse, it aims to contribute to a more informed and discerning approach to scripture interpretation.

### Proof of Concept

I have started building an app as a Proof of Concept using Vue and Leaflet. Currently, it works similarly to the prototype I designed, but it doesn't have all the desired features yet.

Here's what it can do so far:

+ The app can take raw data from a geojson file and display custom markers on an interactive map. These markers are categorized and can be clicked on for more information.
+ The app also includes a side panel that shows details related to the markers. The data for the side panel is also retrieved from the geojson file.
+ In addition, the side panel has a list view of the items, allowing you to search for specific ones and filter them based on categories.
+ However, the items in the list view are currently not connected to the markers on the map. That's the next challenge I plan to work on.

For now, my main focus will be on styling the app to match the prototype, ensuring it looks consistent and visually appealing.

### User Research

Also, this week, I began engaging with potential users and plan to schedule interviews with a Pastor,  a former classmate and a former teacher who possess significant knowledge in biblical backgrounds. These interviews hold valuable importance as they will provide essential feedback on my project, particularly regarding the content and information architecture. Currently, I am actively crafting thoughtful questions for these individuals to ensure that our discussions yield fruitful insights. By anchoring my project around the users' perspectives, I aim to effectively meet their needs and create a user-centric experience.
