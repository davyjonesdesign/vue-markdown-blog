### Overview

As I press forward, I'm grateful for the significant strides made in enhancing the app. Let's take a closer look at the updates for this week:

### Enhancing the Marketing Teaser

In an effort to improve the teaser video, I've made some exciting additions. By carefully selecting words to accompany the aerial shots of Israel and the screen recording, I aim to achieve a smoother transition between the two sections. These words are intended to convey the purpose of the app in a more engaging way. Additionally, I'm considering the inclusion of a transition scene featuring someone using the app on a laptop/desktop. This shot would gradually zoom in until the screen fills the frame, establishing a stronger cohesiveness between the two halves.

### App Development

While I took a break from working on the app this week to focus on the teaser video and capstone project, rest assured that progress hasn't been forgotten. I remain committed to adding real data to all entries and potentially introducing more markers to showcase the app's extensive features.

### Seeking User Feedback

I'm truly grateful for the valuable feedback received from Pastor Kevin, which has provided invaluable insights. Recognizing the importance of diverse perspectives, I plan on reaching out to another experienced individual in biblical scholarship for further input. I have someone in mind whom I plan to contact, and I hope to conduct an interview in the upcoming week.

### Capstone Project Page Initiated

I've made time in my schedule to focus on the development of my capstone project page. This week, I dedicated some time to designing the site using Figma and set up a [basic Vue website](https://davyjonesdesign.github.io/mcad-capstone-website/) with minimal styling, content, and functionality. Moving forward, my efforts will be centered on adding more style, content, and functionality to align with the designs created in Figma.

### Concluding Thoughts

The feedback from the target audience and the quest for an effective data structure remain as guiding forces as I continue this journey. With the progress made in the marketing teaser video and the capstone project site, my next steps will involve refining app features, integrating real data, and incorporating valuable feedback from experts in the field.

I'm sincerely grateful for your support and encouragement as I embark on this exciting path of app development and enrichment of biblical understanding. Stay tuned for more updates as I move forward.
