##### Week 6

# Capturing Feedback

## Synthesizing Feedback + Planning Final Iterations

##### Published July 16, 2023 by Davy Jones

### Overview

This week marked significant milestones in my project. I finalized my marketing teaser video, incorporated valuable feedback from subject matter experts, and continued developing my capstone project page. I'm excited to share the progress made and the insights gained.

### Marketing Teaser Video - Pass 3

I made further revisions to the teaser video I've been working on. Taking into account feedback from the class, I made specific adjustments. I extended the duration of the "Facts on the Ground" shot to allow viewers more time to read the text, separated the "Find it all here" text onto its own slide to enhance its visibility, and added additional time at the end to showcase the logo.

### Subject Matter Expert Feedback

In addition to previous interviews, I conducted another interview with a subject matter expert to gather insights and feedback. After compiling the information, I identified actionable initiatives that will be incorporated into the project during the remaining weeks of the course and beyond.

During the 1-on-1 interview with [Pastor Kevin Earhart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-earhart-1042a8181/), an experienced pastor with 40 years of teaching experience specializing in seniors, I gained valuable insights. I reached out to him because of his honesty, limited technological proficiency, and expertise in teaching scripture to people of all ages.

Pastor Kevin emphasized the importance of providing accurate and properly sourced information within the app and the need for easy access to specific items through a global search or secondary filtering options like categories or biblical books. It was essential to accommodate diverse search preferences as users may have different research approaches. He expressed enthusiasm for filtering data by historical periods, especially in the details section.

Taking this feedback into account, I adjusted the app's design and functionality, improving search options, filtering capabilities, and ensuring proper citation and resource integration. These valuable insights will guide future iterations to meet the needs and expectations of users like Pastor Kevin.

I interviewed [Emma Austin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-austin-a35266a2/), an Old Testament Lecturer and PhD candidate because we shared the experience of studying biblical backgrounds in Israel and she has continued her studies in geographical contexts of scripture.

Emma highlighted the challenges of presenting archaeological and historical information that is constantly evolving and often subject to competing perspectives. She suggested including an academic article summarizing various perspectives and providing a bibliography as well as offering a more practical approach focusing on on-the-ground applications of understanding the biblical story better. In terms of the app's user demographic, Emma emphasized that biblical scholars primarily conduct their own research and may use the app for personal reminders rather than citation purposes.

She also shared how she would use the app as a <em>**teaching tool**</em> to introduce her students to geographical contexts in biblical texts, demonstrating the importance of contextualization for interpreting passages. She expressed the need for an interactive map that allows users to explore each location, view pictures, and access relevant information, creating a sense of journey and engagement. Emma suggested incorporating cross-references or tags to connect different sites and guide users along different thematic paths, such as geographical, narrative, biographical, or scriptural categories.

###### Plan of Action

Upon reflection, I realize that I may have rushed in implementing Kevin's feedback without thoroughly testing its feasibility. Instead of prototyping his suggestions to assess their impact, I immediately proceeded with incorporating them into the app. While I believe these changes have improved the app, I aim to take a different approach when integrating Emma's feedback. Rather than diving into development, I will revisit my Figma prototype and integrate her suggestions into that initial design. This approach offers the advantage of updating my Figma design system and prototype to align better with the current state of the app, facilitating future design and development processes.

<em>Emma's feedback encompasses the following recommendations:</em>

- Incorporating specific locations connected to Joshua's Narrative and Psalm 23.
- Consolidating archeology and history into a dedicated section titled "Academic Overview" with a bibliography.
- Creating related sites sections based on tags such as thematic, biographical, and narrative.

<em>Additionally, I have some ideas of my own that are easily implementable:</em>

- Adding hover labels to markers for improved user experience.
- Exploring different color treatments to enhance visual appeal and usability.

### Capstone Project Page Updates

Progress continues on my Capstone page at [capstone.davyjones.me](https://capstone.davyjones.me/). I have set up the website's functionality and will now focus on adding content and styling to match the Figma designs. Here's a glimpse of the current state of the website:

### Concluding Thoughts

Looking ahead, there is still significant work to be done, but I am genuinely confident about the direction of my project for the first time this semester. I am eager to refine the design system, enhance the Figma prototype, and develop the capstone project page. Stay tuned for more updates as I make further progress.
