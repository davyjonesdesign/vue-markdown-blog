# Final Weeks

## Wrapping Up + Presentation Prep

##### Published Aug 9, 2023 by Davy Jones

### Introduction

These past few weeks have been a real rollercoaster. Aside from welcoming my second little bundle of joy, I've been in overdrive getting my capstone page in sync with the final presentation, nailing down those citations, and giving the Vue app and prototype a bit of a makeover.

Thanks to a nudge from my classmate Alex Conover, I've got this marketing teaser video cooking. It's almost done, just a few tweaks left to make on the live app screens. But the real aim here is to pack in the project's core essence in a way that grabs attention. After quite a few rounds of feedback, I think it's doing the trick.

### Figma Prototype

Emma Austin's insights got me rethinking things. I tucked non-geographical info into an academic overview spot, possibly as an expandable section or a downloadable PDF. I'm also adding an interactive related sites feature, something that got its first glimpse in the prototype and will soon strut its stuff in the app. Here you can see the [full screen prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/xLh7aq2HW1eUzrIFbNJlph/WIS_final?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=225-2746&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=225%3A2746&mode=design&t=IElURtzA5SxrTKsM-1).

### Design System

Colors have got a facelift in the [design system](https://www.figma.com/proto/xLh7aq2HW1eUzrIFbNJlph/WIS_final?page-id=1%3A9&type=design&node-id=121-782&viewport=322%2C2%2C0.2&t=0B7cV5InZELEc0Yh-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=121%3A782&mode=design). I've mapped out patterns and components, splitting them into the here-and-now and the down-the-road sections.

### MVP Vue + Leaflet App

I'm jazzing up the [live Vue app](https://wis.davyjones.me) with the new colors. My game plan is to lock that in before I go big on other additions, like that related sites section. The app as it stands gives a solid peek into how a regular user might dive into things - searching, filtering, and gaining insights.

As I visualized folks checking out my work, it sparked some design and app tweaks. The sheer amount of content made it clear â€“ I needed to streamline. So, scriptwriting based on my capstone page was the starting point. But I realized there's a limit, and trimming down was in order. I ended up chopping, rewriting, and streamlining till I was down to just under 12 minutes. A little help from friends fine-tuned it further, making for a punchy presentation.

### Conclusion

In the grand wrap-up, these past weeks have been a wild yet rewarding ride, where I've fine-tuned, polished, and streamlined to bring this project to a roaring finish.
