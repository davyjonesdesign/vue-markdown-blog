Marketing Teaser Ad: During our weekly meeting, a suggestion was made to create a short teaser marketing video as an additional component for my project. This video would introduce the app and serve as a way to generate interest and communicate its purpose. With this feedback in mind, I began working on the teaser ad. In the initial design, I incorporated captivating screen recordings, compelling logo motion graphics, and royalty-free aerial shots of Israel to visually engage the audience and convey the essence of the project. I am excited to receive feedback from my instructor and classmates regarding this new component, as their insights will help further refine it.

### App Updates

**Real Data Integration:** Also this week, I started loading in real data to the app to enhance the authenticity of the marker's details page, actual data Though the information is mostly based off less than reliable sources like Wikipedia, it has helped me better understand the data structure and how the app’s design needs to change to accommodate for the real data.

**Filter by Time Period:**  Based on feedback from Pastor Kevin, I have added a filter dropdown on the search page, allowing users to explore information based on different historical periods. This enhances the user experience and facilitates targeted exploration. I plan to extend this functionality to the details page as well, where users can change the time period and load corresponding data. With successful preliminary testing, I aim to accomplish this in the upcoming week, ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Search and Matched Section:** In response to valuable feedback from a variety of target audiences, I made an important update mid-week to enhance the search functionality. Recognizing the significance of the search as the primary method of finding information, I decided to incorporate a "matched" section into the search results. This addition aims to improve the user experience by prominently highlighting the relevant content that aligns with the user's search query. By streamlining the information retrieval process and providing users with a clear and concise overview of the matching results, the app becomes more efficient and user-friendly. This improvement demonstrates my commitment to delivering a high-quality experience that meets the needs and expectations of our users.

### User/Target Audience Feedback

The feedback integration process continues to play a crucial role in refining the project. This week, in addition to Pastor Kevin's valuable insights, I reached out to a collegiate audience to gather their perspectives:

**Pastor Kevin (Cleric Audience):** Pastor Kevin, with his extensive 40 years of teaching experience, provided valuable insights into the project. He emphasized the significance of accurate information, citation, and resources within the app. Taking his suggestions into account, the project team is actively integrating these aspects into the app's design to enhance its credibility and reliability.

**Collegiate Audience:** Engaging with the collegiate audience will provide a fresh perspective and valuable input. I’m hoping their feedback will spark ideas for future iterations and improvements, shaping the project's direction and aligning it with the needs and expectations of this target group.

### Updated Project Plan

The project plan has been further refined to ensure a smooth progression towards the final deliverables. A detailed schedule has been established, outlining the remaining tasks and milestones. Additionally, initial considerations for the Capstone Page have begun, envisioning an online platform that effectively showcases the project's features, purpose, and benefits to potential users.

With each passing week, the project continues to evolve, driven by the integration of user feedback, the addition of new components, and the continuous improvement of app functionalities. I remain committed to delivering a user-centric and enriching experience, empowering individuals to deepen their biblical understanding and approach scripture interpretation with confidence.

Stay tuned for more updates in the upcoming weeks as we inch closer to the completion of this exciting project!
