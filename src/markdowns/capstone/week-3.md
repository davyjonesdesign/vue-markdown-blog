### Overview

Despite the challenges faced this week, significant progress has been made in advancing the project. Here's a summary of completed tasks and remaining to-dos:

Completed:

+ Styling for markers and sidepanel
+ Integration of leaflet map provider
+ Introduction of sticky scrolling tabs to details page
+ Feedback received on data structure from Pastor Kevin

To Do:

+ Introduce marker legend
+ Typography improvements
+ Side panel enhancements: list view styling, footer, category marker, images for list items and details page
+ Input real data

### Effective Data Structure + Real Data Integration

To establish a solid foundation for the marker's details page, I have begun outlining the data structure. Seeking feedback from various individuals, including people, users, and professionals, is crucial to refine the data structure and improve its usability.

In addition, gathering real data for at least one marker entry is essential for obtaining accurate content representation. Integrating actual data will enable informed decisions regarding the app's design and structure, enhancing its functionality and aligning it with the intended purpose and user expectations.

### Overview Statement Revision

The overview statement has been revised since last week. While initially focused on combating spiritual abuse, I recognized that it shouldn't be the primary objective as the project doesn't directly address it. Instead, the emphasis has shifted towards enriching biblical understanding. By making biblical backgrounds and knowledge accessible to everyone, the project aims to contribute to a more informed approach to scripture interpretation. While preventing spiritual abuse may be a byproduct, the main goal remains enhancing biblical understanding for individuals.

### User/Target Audience Feedback

During the interview with Pastor Kevin, a local with 40 years of teaching experience, valuable insights were gathered:

+ **Information Search:** Pastor Kevin relies on Google searches and uses Wikipedia as a starting point to identify credible sources for further research.
+ **Filtering by Timelines:** Pastor Kevin expressed great interest in the ability to filter information by different historical periods, particularly on the details page. He suggested a dropdown or multiselect option to select and display data from different periods, with the selected information labeled and appended to each section in chronological order.
+ **Global Search and Filter Options:** A global search feature should be the primary method of finding information, while filter options should serve as a secondary means of searching. Different users may have diverse research approaches, so accommodating various search preferences is important.
+ **Emphasis on Accuracy and Citations:**  Pastor Kevin highlighted the importance of accuracy and citation within the app. Providing evidence, research, and the writer's process leading to their conclusions is crucial. Integrating resources, citations, and verifiable data into the app's core design is essential.

Taking into account this feedback, adjustments will be made to the app's design, including search options, filtering functionalities, and proper citation and resource integration. These insights will guide future iterations and improvements to meet the needs and expectations of users like Pastor Kevin.
