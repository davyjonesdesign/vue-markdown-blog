The feeling of being done is pretty surreal. Big shoutout to everyone who’s helped me on this journey. Looking back, a few takeaways hit home:

- **Loved every moment:** Honestly, making this has been a blast.
- **Bit off more, and it paid off:** I did bite off more than I can chew, but it’s been a priceless learning experience.
- **Me in a nutshell:** The project truly showcases my dev-design chops.
- **Wish I’d reached out sooner:** Lesson learned: more early collaboration next time, for sure.
- **More to come:** This is just the tip of the iceberg that is Written in Stone.

### What surprised you?

I was surprised by how much this project became an exploration and experiment. In the exploratory part, I didn't expect the big changes that happened in the second half of the project. Also, I didn't think things would fit so well in the final presentation, even though it feels like the project is just starting.

In the experimental part, I set myself up for doing more than I planned, just by trying to build a small part of it. This app was different from what I've made before – in the past, I only created simple blog-like Vue apps. So, I was using technology I wasn't familiar with. Maybe that wasn't the best idea, but I'm glad I tried things out during development. It took me on some odd paths sometimes, but in the end, it helped me make better choices and create a stronger end result.

### How did things evolve, match up, or fall short of expectations?

Initially, I thought my Vue app would be smaller. But I had some great breakthroughs that gave me extra time. So, I added more features I hadn't planned.
Yet, while developing, I saw things I didn't consider, like map interactions and how content is organized.

So, the app turned out better than I thought, but now I realize there's even more to do. I feel like I've learned a lot, yet there's much more work ahead. It's a mix of feeling accomplished and having more to tackle. Like being close to done but not quite there. It's a push and pull between finished and unfinished.

### What presented the biggest challenge?

My main hurdle wasn't about the project itself, but more about finding a balance in life. During this project, my wife was pregnant and we had an 11-month-old baby at home. Juggling the project and family time was tougher than I thought. I sacrificed sleep, especially when the baby arrived in the last two weeks. Some aspects of the project I wished to delve into more got pushed aside. 

Throughout most of the project, the biggest challenge was figuring out when to stop and say, "that's enough for now." This was especially true for the presentation. Many project parts felt unfinished by the end of the semester. However, embracing the idea of leaving things somewhat open taught me patience and discipline. I've reached a point where I'm fine with things being incomplete yet complete. That's how I feel today, at least!

### What do you measure as your greatest success?

To me, the project's standout achievement was the presentation. I've struggled with presenting; my tendency to over-explain and stumble over words is a known challenge. Summarizing concisely hasn't been my strong suit either (those progress updates are proof). So, managing to deliver a 12-minute presentation without stumbling or unnecessary repetition feels like a major victory. It has boosted my confidence in the approach I took for this presentation and the process I can replicate moving forward.

### What takeaway do you use going forward, either as a continuing project/asset, or a lesson?

A significant lesson I've learned is the importance of proactively engaging with a broader audience at an earlier stage and sharing my work more frequently. It's become evident that the pivotal moments in the project arose when I sought out input and feedback. It stands to reason that incorporating multiple rounds of feedback during the initial phases could have potentially propelled me further in refining the final deliverables.

### How will the project serve your career development?

This project really highlights my skills, especially in solving tricky problems where design meets real-world development. It also reflects my background and what I'm passionate about – a field I'm eager to dive deeper into. This isn't just a quick snapshot; it's more like a full album showcasing what drives me and where I want to make a bigger impact.

### What's next?

For the immediate future, I plan to shelve this project and spend more time with my family. When I do return to it, there are a few items of action I have in mind:

- I plan to integrate prototype styling and functions into the live Vue app.
- I would like to design and develop a mobile version.
- I need to conduct further research and gather user feedback along the way.
- I need to reach out to and collaborate with partners – in the hopes of adapting the app to various community contexts (nonprofits, colleges, churches, etc.).

### Conclusion

With these goals in sight, I'm excited about the dynamic evolution that lies ahead for this project.
