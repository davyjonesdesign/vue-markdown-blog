# Capstone: Getting Started
#### May 25, 2023

I am dedicated to developing an innovative research tool for biblical scholars and students, which will provide a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for exploring the ancient Middle East. With a focus on countering misconceptions and simplistic interpretations of scripture, the tool will offer the following key functionalities:

1. **Interactive Map** — Explore archaeological sites and detailed findings;
2. **Historical and Cultural Context** — Understand the rich historical background of the Bible;
3. **Dispelling Misconceptions** — Access accurate data to challenge misconceptions;
4. **Counteracting Simplistic Interpretations** — Engage in critical analysis of biblical text;
5. **Search and Filtering** — Quickly find specific locations and related information;
6. **Quick Filters** — Streamline navigation with predefined filters;
7. **List/Map View Toggle** — Switch between list and map views;
8. **Map Item Selection** — Access detailed information by selecting items on the map;
9. **Bookmark Selections** — Save preferred locations for future reference;
10. **Save Comments Within** — Add personal notes and reflections to enhance research;
