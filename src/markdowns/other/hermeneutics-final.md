## Exegetical Summaries


### Background Analysis (Hiccup)

  1. The following are findings based on the **Historical** background.
    1. The author of the book of John was John, the apostle, who…
      1. was a Palestinian Jew familiar with the topography of Jerusalem
      2. was named along with James, a "son of thunder" by Jesus, probably reflecting their impetuous temper or powerful voices
      3. was a pillar of the Church in Jerusalem
      4. is presumed to be the beloved disciple whom Jesus loved in the book of John and who Jesus entrusted with care of his mother to at the foot of the cross
      5. and was also a member of the inner three disciples of Jesus as named by Matthew and Luke and was an eye witness to key events in Jesus' ministry
    2. The book of John is believed to have been written at the end of the first century at a time when the church was mainly gentile and influenced by Greco-Roman Culture with emphasis on the reflecting of or wonderment of history.
    3. From the dissection of it, it looks as though John was written with a Jewish audience in mind but more specifically directed towards an audience outside of Palestine who were in part ignorant of Jewish customs; this leads us to assume that perhaps John wrote this book for the Jews of the Diaspora and proselytes in Hellenistic Synagogues.
  2. The following are findings based on the **Cultural** background.
    1. A popular thought of the day among the Jews was that God's promise of a glorious national future had not yet been fulfilled and because the Jews at the time were still subjective to Rome that meant that they were not following Torah the way they should be; this made the keeping of the Law of Moses as prescriptions and commands very essential for the deliverance of the nation and the fulfillment of God's promises.
    2. Concerning the "Johannine community", it's speculated that this distinct community's break with the synagogues in Ephesus may have contributed to the Gospel's vitriolic language used against the Jews.
    3. A system of alleged esoteric knowledge purveyed by mystery cults and syncretistic philosophy of their time, in which John and Paul write in conscious contrast with, is one which states that knowledge is a result of initiation and illumination, making spiritual discernment take presidency over reason and faith; John and Paul both wrote that knowledge is the committal to the historical Christ and that their not opposed to faith but that no revelation other than Christ is needed.
  3. The following are findings based on the **Physical** background.
    1. It is believed that John writes his Gospel and his three letters in Asia Minor and specifically at Ephesus before his banishment to the island of Patmos where he writes Revelation (see map)

### Language Analysis

  1. The following are findings based off of _ **word studies** _ conducted on the prominent and important words found in John 1:14-18.
    1. In John1:14 & 18, the words "one and only" are used in the NIV to translate the Greek word _ **monogenēs** _ (3666 G/K).
      1. With an occurrence of only nine times, _monogenēs_ is used in primarily two different senses throughout the New Testament (semantic range). Either it is used…
        1. to denote the singularity of something meaning not more than one, or
        2. to denote something or someone as matchless, without equal or beyond repair (specifically used in describing Christ)
      2. _Monogenēs_ is used to mark out Jesus as uniquely above all earthly and heavenly beings.
      3. The meaning of _monogenēs_ is centered in the personal existence of the son and not the generation of the son.
      4. Jesus as _monogenēs_ does not disappear in history and the historical but stands over them as the one who can say, "I and the Father are one".
    2. In John 1:14, the word "word" is used in the NIV to translate the Greek word _ **logos** _ (3364 G/K).
      1. The word _logos_ reflects the idea that Jesus' words are the words of the Father and therefore are words of salvation to believers but also words of judgment to unbelievers and in both cases that Jesus is the self-revelation of God to man.
      2. _Logos_ also denotes Jesus as the divine revealer and redeemer
      3. _Logos_ reflects the idea that the incarnation of the word to flesh is the presence of God in the person of Jesus and not just the present activity of God in the words of Jesus.
    3. In John 1:16, the word "received" is used in the NIV to translate the Greek word _ **lambano** _ (3284 G/K).
      1. In the New Testament, _lambano_ had either two meanings…
        1. to take, remove, take possession of, admit (allow), or
        2. to receive, which corresponds with God's giving and man's recieving
      2. Building of the second definition of _lambano_, Jesus lives by receiving (commission, spirit, power) from the Father and whoever receives him has a share of his inexhaustible grace and receives the Holy Spirit
  2. The following are findings based off of _ **figurative language** _ found in John 1:14-18.
    1. The first section of _figurative language_ found are **Figures of Association (1)**
      1. There are two instances of _synecdoche_ found
        1. In verse 14, the synecdoche (of the part) is that flesh is put for the whole and true humanity of Christ
        2. In verse 16, the synecdoche (of the genus) is that the "all" is put for the greater parts because the "all" is defined and limited by the "we"
    2. The second section of _figurative language_ found are **Figures of Humanization (1)**
      1. There is one instance of _Anthropopatheia_ used when in verse 18 when the bosom is attributed to God to denote comfort and rest.
    3. The third section of _figurative language_ found are **Figures of Illusion (3)**
      1. In verse 14, a _genitive case_ occurs with "full of grace and truth" which implies to be filled with grace and truth.
      2. In verse 15, a _heterosis (of tenses)_ occurs for when John says "this is HE for whom I said": the past is being used for the present.
      3. In verse 18, an _Ellipses (repetition or preceding connected words)_ is used when the statements of "No one has ever seen God" and "but God…has made him known" have a repeated sentiment of seeing God. The latter omits the actual words but they are implied anyway.
    4. The fourth section of figurative language found are **Figures of Comparison (2)**
      1. In verse 15, _simile_ is used as a figure to imply that the Father's glory and the glory of the one and only aren't merely identical in resemblance but that they are each other one in the same.
      2. In verse 17, a _Hendiadys (two for one)_ is used when truth and grace are coupled together; to take one literally would not be true in fact.

### Contextual Analysis

  1. The outline of John 1:14-18 is divided into 4 major particulars; _The Incarnation of Christ, John the Baptist's Testimony Concerning Christ_, _God's Grace-Based Gifts_,and _Jesus' Unique Standing_; each of these sections could be broken and are broken down into even more distinct sections in the following.
    1. _The Incarnation of Christ_ can be broken down into three distinct sections which are…
      1. the physical body (flesh) of Christ
      2. the year-measured life of Christ and
      3. the witness of his glory which can be broken down into two more sections of…
        1. denoted as being full of truth
        2. denoted as being full of grace
    2. _John the Baptist's Testimony Concerning Christ_ can be broken down into three distinct sections which are…
      1. the future coming of Christ
      2. the fact that He is greater than John
      3. the fact that He came before John as well
    3. _God's Grace-Based Gifts_ are…
      1. the law of Moses and
      2. truth and grace through Jesus Christ
    4. _Jesus' Unique Standing_ can be broken down into two categories which are…
      1. the only one who sees God and
      2. God's representative to Humanity
  2. The **context** of John 1:14-18 can be determined by the _purpose and plan_ of John's writing, the _immediate context_ of the passage as a whole, and the _general context_ of the book as a whole.
    1. The aim of the Gospel of John can be found within the Gospel in John 20:30-31, which basically says that the _purpose_ of John's writing, is to inspire belief in Jesus and by believing in Jesus, have life.
      1. John consciously stressed points which would refuse the false and antagonistic views about Jesus held by Jews in his times
      2. John sought to set forth the significance of the personal, historical life of Jesus rather than seeking out the theory of the universe as Philo, Heraclitus and the stoics of his day attempted to do.
      3. John also attempted, in his writing to John, to correct the Church's eschatology against Gnosticism.
    2. In the _immediate context__of the passage_, we can conclude that in the prologue, John answers what Jesus really was and what his relations to God, to man, and to the world were and these things are further demonstrated by the narrative following the prologue as well.
      1. The "hymn to Jesus as logos" (prologue) of God reflects the corporate confession of those who have heard the message of the gospel and have beheld his glory.
      2. The passage is preceded by the text's denial of John the Baptist being the Christ and is followed by the John the Baptist's denial of himself being the Christ; the significance of this is found in John's insignificance in comparison with Jesus in the fact that all of God's glory is show through Jesus unlike in John the Baptist.
      3. To further this point, this denial of being the Christ by John the Baptist is followed by the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptism; this is John the Baptist's first hand witness account of the glory that John, the writer of the gospel, tries to illustrate in the prologue but that John the Baptist sees.
    3. In the _general context of the book_, it seems as though John uses the prologue and specifically, John 1:16-18 to outline all of John, breaking it up into two distinct sections: _Jesus' Revelation of Glory_ and _God's Glorification of the Revealed_
      1. The first section, _Jesus' Revelation of Glory_, denoted by the declaration of God's grace-based gifts (John 1:16-17) and involves the 7 signs and discourses and most of Jesus' public ministry. (1-11)
      2. The second section, _God's Glorification of the Revealed_, denoted from the explication of Jesus' unique standing (John 1:18) and involves the Passion Week, the death and the resurrection of Jesus as the glorified son. (12-21)
  
### Doctrinal Analysis

  1. Through the **Unity** and **Coherence** of _scripture to scripture_ referencing, the addition of material can be added to the passage because scripture is the best commentary for scripture.
    1. In Revelation 19:13 and 1 John 1:1, John again calls Jesus the "Word" and the "Word of Life".
    2. In Hebrews 1:1-3, the author makes the main point that Jesus has always been God's way to us and vise versa in the facts that…
      1. Jesus is heir of all things
      2. Jesus is the representation of God's being
      3. Jesus is God's powerful word (through which the universe was made)
      4. Jesus provided the purification of sins and
      5. Jesus is glorified with the Father
    3. In Galatians 3:23-25, we are shown that only faith can justify us in the grace and truth that Christ has given us in John 1:17.
    4. In Philippians 2:5-11 we can see that glory flows from the Father to Jesus in God's exaltation of the son and that the incarnation is an act of self-humility taken on by Jesus who was in nature, God.
    5. In Psalms 33: 6 and 33:9, we again see that the word is the creation agent of the world and because Jesus is the word, then by logical deduction, Jesus is the creation agent of the world.
  2. There were only 2 external **Biblical Difficulties** found from other verses and are in accordance to…
    1. Verse 18 which says "no one has seen god at anytime" but Exodus 33:11 and Gen 32:30 both speak of accounts where men such as Moses and Jacob speak to God, face to face.
      1. Later in Exodus 33:20, it says that "no man shall the [the Lord's] face and live" which is in contradiction to the account before in Exodus; in between Moses asks to see the Lord's glory and the Lord says no concerning his glory
      2. This enlightens the idea that seeing God changes from typical face to face revealing to sinful humans as the Lord has already been involved with to revealing Himself in all his glory, something unbearable to the human condition.
      3. Likewise, in John, John is discussing God's fullness of grace when he says that we cannot see his face.
      4. This further promotes the uniqueness of Christ as a man who can and has seen God in all his glory.
    2. Verses 14 and 18 which calls Jesus God's "one and only [son]" but throughout scripture others are called "son(s) of God"
      1. For example, Adam (Luke 3:38), the Angels (Job 1:6, 2:1, 38:7) and believers (Matt 5:9, Rom 8:14, 19, Gal 3:26) are all called "son(s) of God"
      2. A "son of God" of "son(s) of God" are appellations for those who follow after God, but the phrase "the son of God is only used for Jesus Christ.
      3. Other terms like this used for Jesus throughout scripture are
        1. "only begotten son"
        2. "His [God] own son" and
        3. "the Son" when God is referred to as "the Father"
      4. Jesus is called "one and only" son as the unique son of God, the second person of the Godhead, and an elite position that neither angelic being nor member of humanity can share.
  
### Application

  1. **The Divinely Intended Audience** is all people to all places at all times and the principles found in this passage are that Jesus is the word that Jesus brought truth and grace, and that Jesus saw and reflected the full glory of the Father.
    1. These three principles are not limited by context because the text does not limit them to a designated specific audience.
    2. These three principles are not limited by other scripture but are rather supported and better understood by other scripture (see Doctrinal Analysis)
    3. This passage applies to the church and individual Christians today because without these principles, major doctrine of Christianity goes missing and our salvation is rendered nonexistent; rather, Christians should take these principles and hold them as core belief because they are true.
  2. In **Application** , because these principles are not implied but are explicitly, clearly and directly stated to a universal audience, these principles should be trusted and obeyed.
    1. In light of this, the application of these principles to one's life in our culture of today's America, one should respond to John's presentation of the gospel as Christians have done so ever since John wrote his Gospel; with belief in who Jesus is and what he did for us.
    2. Cross-culturally, this presentation and acceptance of the gospel may look different, but at the core, it is the same for everyone; a person must realize their broken state humanity and that Jesus is the word, that He sees and reflects the full glory of the Father and that he brought truth and grace to our world.
    3. Ultimately the person must believe this and in turn let this belief take over and control their actions

### Genre

  1. In light of the gospel genre, this passage should be understood in light of the facts that it is an ancient biography, that it is a Christological biography and that it enthusiastically endorsed Jesus.
  2. This story tells us that Jesus is the word that was with God in the beginning, through whom all things were made, that Jesus brought truth and grace from the Father, and that Jesus sees and reflects the Father's full glory.
  3. The Gospel writer is telling us by mentioning John the Baptist as a man who came as a witness to testify concerning the light (Jesus) and after this passage the testimony of John the Baptist is given concerning John's Baptism of Jesus that the significance of John the Baptist is that compared to the one who he was witnessing for and who was to come, John is insignificant and here, the contrast is made between the two of them.

### Exegesis and Exposition Statement

John, the apostle, who was presumed to be the beloved disciple whom Jesus loved in the book of John, who Jesus entrusted with care of his mother to at the foot of the cross, who was also a member of the inner three disciples of Jesus and an eye witness to key events in Jesus' ministry writes John with the intention to inspire belief in Christ and fight against Gnosticism giving emphasis to the nonessential need of revelation other than that of Christ to a Jewish audience in mind but more specifically directed towards an audience outside of Palestine who were in part ignorant of Jewish customs from Ephesus before being banished to the Island of Patmos saying "The word" of the Greek word _logos_ (3364G/K), which reflects the idea that Jesus' words are the words of the Father, words of salvation to believers, words of judgment to unbelievers, that Jesus is the self-revelation of God to man, the presence of God is in the person of Jesus and that also Jesus is the creation agent in through which the universe was made "became flesh", flesh put for the full humanity of Christ and the physical body of Christ, "and made his dwelling among us" referring to the year-measured life of Christ. "We have seen his glory", which flows from the Father to Jesus in the Father's exaltation of him, "the glory of the one and only [son]" one and only coming from the Greek word, _monogenēs_ (3666 G/K) used in the sense of matchless and unique (a uniqueness that no other son of God can share: angels, believers, nor Adam) among all things, centered in the personal existence of Christ who is one with the Father, who's glory is here assimilated with the Father's, "who came from the Father full of grace and truth", meaning filled with grace and truth which are both brought equally and together by Jesus from the Father to man. "John testifies concerning him", John the Baptist who denies Christhood and baptizes Jesus, who's insignificance points to Jesus significance by the contrasting of him and Jesus "testifies concerning him", Jesus, "He cries out saying 'This was he" a past for present substitution, "of who said , 'He who comes after me" the future coming of Christ, "has surpassed me", meaning Jesus is greater than John the Baptist, "because he was before me", meaning Jesus preexisted John the Baptist's ministry. "From the fullness of his grace we have all", all being defined and limited by we, "received", from the Greek word _lambano_ (3284 G/K) which corresponds with God's giving and man's receiving which is fully encapsulated in Jesus who lives by receiving so that whoever receives him has a share of his inexhaustible grace and receives the Holy Spirit, "one blessing after another". Setting up the first half of John (1-11) as Jesus' Revelation of the Glory, John writes "for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth", which only faith can justify us in this truth and grace, "came through Jesus Christ", the contrast between the law of Moses and the grace/truth of Jesus is made here to counter the strict following of law in efforts to gain the future promise of the deliverance of the nation of Israel from Roman rule. However, both the law and truth/grace are God's grace–based gifts to man and beyond this; grace and truth cannot be taken separately. Setting up the second half of John (12-21) as God's Glorification of the Revealed, John writes "No one has ever seen God, but God the one and only" (_monogenēs_) who in light of God's glory is the only one who has seen the Father and the repeating of the idea of seeing the father here denotes Jesus' uniqueness of being the only one who has seen the father, "who is at the Father's side, has made him known", as the representative of God to humanity and who sees and reflects the full glory of the Father. This is universal in application to all people everywhere in all times and because it is explicitly stated it should be trusted and obeyed.

### Self- Evaluation based on Commentaries

After careful consideration of the commentaries on John Reading John: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the Fourth Gospel and the Johannine Epistles by Charles H. Talbert and The Expositor's Commentary with the New Interntational Version by Merrill C. Tenney, I can now see that perhaps I could have paid more attention to immediate context of the passage and it's structural differences and complication within the prologue itself. I also have found that the word/logos prologue is extremely similar to how wisdom is described in the Old Testament. Furthermore, I wish I had done word studies on surpassed and the last phrase in 18, "has made him known" along with how the term God is used in this passage. Overall, however, I feel as though I managed to cover a broad spectrum of useful information in interpreting this passage and while doing so, gained experience and knowledge that has and will further my biblical studies now and in the future.
